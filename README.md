# pivo-detection

Detection model for detecting pivo (beer) objects in images.
Easily load and use the pretrained model with PyTorch Hub.

---

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) installed.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision ultralytics
```

---

## Usage

You can load the model directly with PyTorch Hub:

```python
import torch

model = torch.hub.load(
    'Ramnck/pivo-detection',
    'model',
    pretrained=True,  # Download weights automatically
)

# Example: Inference on an image
# img = ... (H, W, 3) numpy or PIL.Image or torch tensor
results = model(img)
# results contains predicted masks/bboxes/scores
```

---

## Input Format

* **Image**: Accepts PIL.Image, numpy array (H, W, 3), or torch tensor (C, H, W)
* **Output**: Dict or object containing bounding boxes and confidence scores.
